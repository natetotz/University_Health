Dataset
This dataset was compiled by the team at Prof G (it has no affiliation with NYU Stern School of Business). It includes data on 442 undergraduate US universities and colleges ranked by US News & World Report's top National University and National College rankings. This dataset compiles data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) maintained by the US Department of Education, US News & World Report, Google Keyword Planner, Niche.com's Student Life Scores, and the Center on Education & the Workforce. IPEDS. data is self-reported by each school. This dataset/scores should not be taken as peer-reviewed or final. It is a working document that seeks to analyze and understand the US college & university landscape. We've excluded universities and colleges that we do not have complete data for.

Scores
This document gives schools two scores. A Value-to-Cost Ratio, which seeks to quantify each school's value relative to its tuition cost, and a Vulnerability Score, which seeks to quantify a school's vulnerability to Covid-19. The Value-to-Cost Ratio is based on three metrics: Credential (the school's reputation and ability to serve as a career accelerant), Experience (the enrichment potential of the on-campus and community aspects of the school), and Education (the caliber of instruction and its long term impact). We chose from the available data measures that best quantified these considerations and then calculated each school's relative position on these measures to determine a score for each metric. We multipled scores for these three metrics and divided by a tuition score to create a ratio. A Value-to-Cost Ratio of 1.00 indicates that a school's value is proportional to its tuition cost. For Vulnerability, low endowment and dependence on full-tuition international students make a university vulnerable to Covid shock, as they may decide to sit this semester/year out. 

Note: This data should be taken as directional and relative -- we use percent rank to evaluate each metric relative to the 442 schools analyzed. There are many variables not included here that may bolster this scoring -- some of which we've thought of but have not yet found strong datasets (i.e. universities with hospitals or a high share of students who commute are likely less vulnerable) and some we have likely not thought of. Higher education faces an unprecedented crisis in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic; we hope this data can help us see the outlines of this crisis, and advance the discussion towards facing it. We welcome suggestions, thoughts, pushback, or things we may have missed at feedback@section4.com.

Categorizations (more information here): Schools have been categorized into four buckets: 1) Thrive: High Value, Low Vulnerability, 2) Survive: High Value, High Vulnerability, 3) Struggle: Low Value, Low Vulnerability, 4) Challenged: Low Value, High Vulnerability

Update (as of 8/4/20): Changes have been made to this sheet since publication of the USS University blog post, so a few school's category assignments may have changed. This includes the addition of LSU, Penn State, Sewanee, University of Northern Colorado, Virginia Tech, and Wheaton College (MA) (erroniously missing), CU-Boulder (after finding complete data), and University of Buffalo (mistakenly labeled as Buffalo State). We also updated search volume numbers for ~20 schools to account for more colloquial search terms (i.e. Georgia Tech vs. Georgia Institute of Technology) and have updated international student percentages for about 50 schools which were inaccurately reported by the IPEDS, and we were able to find accurate numbers on the school's website. Note: We've also received questions about using average net tuitition price (after aid) vs. the average sticker price we use now. We have yet to find a strong enough data source here but continue to look into it. Previous versions of this document categorized schools as ""Perish"" -- we've updated this categorization to ""Challenged.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
